### Flight HUD & Multiplier Animation — Directive
- Multiplier curve must render at 60fps target; gracefully degrade to 30fps on low-tier devices.
- Utilize requestAnimationFrame; detach rendering from business logic; maintain deterministic state.
- Easing functions: cubic-bezier tuned per phase (taxi, takeoff, climb, turbulence, crash).
- Accessibility: reduce-motion media query respects user prefs; provide alternative text readouts.
- Synchronization: HUD state machine listens to streaming events; never blocks on network.
- Crash event: 80–120ms 'snap' with chromatic aberration suppressed; avoid seizure triggers.
- Cash Out: immediate feedback with optimistic ledger entry; fallback rollback with toast.
### Payment UI — Edge Case Matrix
| Scenario | UI Expectation | Telemetry | Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3DS challenge timeout | Show countdown, allow retry, provide fallback method | payment.3ds.timeout | Offer alternative UPI/card flow |
| UPI mandate pending | Badge 'Pending'; explain SLA; notify via toaster | payment.upi.pending | Trigger manual refresh CTA |
| Card BIN blocked | Inline error with link to policy doc | payment.card.bin_blocked | Suggest other payment rails |
| Network blip | Spinner with offline banner; auto-retry backoff | payment.net.blip | Queue and resume pattern |
| Double-tap Cash Out | Debounce & idempotency key; surface last confirmed txn | cashout.doubletap | Show recent tx list |
