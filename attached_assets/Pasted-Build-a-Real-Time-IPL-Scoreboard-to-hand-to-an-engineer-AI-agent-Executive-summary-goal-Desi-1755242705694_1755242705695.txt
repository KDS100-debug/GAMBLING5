Build a Real-Time IPL Scoreboard (to hand to an engineer / AI agent)

Executive summary (goal):
Design and deliver a production-grade, real-time IPL scoreboard that ingests live match data from an external source (preferred: official/licensed API; fallback: well-controlled scraping with legal review), normalizes it, and streams live updates to web and mobile clients with sub-second/near-real-time UX. The system must be resilient, auditable, rate-limit aware, and compliant with the data provider’s TOS.

1) Project scope & acceptance criteria

Minimum viable feature set

Live list of ongoing IPL matches with scoreline (team names, runs/wickets, overs, run-rate, required runs, target, innings, toss/winner when complete).

Ball-by-ball updates (where available) pushed to clients in real time.

Match detail view: scorecard (bat/bowl), fall-of-wicks, commentary feed.

Client reconnect / gap-fill logic so no events are missed after transient disconnects.

Admin dashboard: data feed health, latency metrics, API usage and error rates.

Non-functional

Data freshness SLA: updates delivered to clients within 1–3s of source update (where source supports that cadence).

Scalable: support many concurrent clients (use WebSockets/Socket.IO or server-push).

Secure: API keys stored safely; rate limits respected; logging and monitoring enabled.

Deliverables

Backend service(s) with documented REST/WebSocket endpoints.

Frontend live scoreboard (React recommended) demonstrating real-time updates.

Deployment scripts / Dockerfiles and run instructions.

Test plan and integration checklist with the selected data provider.

2) Data source options (pick one; recommended = licensed API)

Recommended: licensed cricket data providers (production, commercial). Examples: SportMonks, Sportradar, SportDevs, EntitySport — they provide official/paid live feeds and ball-by-ball events suitable for production use. Use these first for legality, reliability, and service level guarantees.

Affordable / Developer tiers / freemium: CricAPI / cricketdata.org / api-cricket — good for prototyping but confirm coverage/limits and licensing for IPL.

Unofficial / scraping / reverse-engineered endpoints: There exist community projects and wrappers for ESPNcricinfo / Cricbuzz JSON endpoints. These can work for PoC but carry legal/TOS/robustness risks; avoid for production unless you have legal clearance. Examples of community wrappers on GitHub exist.

3) Legal & compliance guardrails (must include)

Prefer licensed API with a written contract for production (data redistribution, caching, attribution, usage caps). See vendor docs/pricing.

If considering scraping, obtain legal/TOS review before deployment; implement strict rate limiting, caching, and attribution rules; be ready to switch providers if blocked.

4) High-level architecture (recommended)

Ingest layer

Connector service(s) that call the licensed API or poll official endpoints / subscribe to webhooks. Normalizes incoming data into internal canonical event format.

Rate limiter + backoff + retry logic.

Optionally, a lightweight scraping adapter only for non-commercial PoC (explicitly flagged).

Message bus

Lightweight queue/streaming (Redis Streams, Kafka, or RabbitMQ) for decoupling ingestion and distribution.

Real-time distribution

WebSocket service (Socket.IO or native WebSocket) or server-sent events (SSE) for browser/mobile clients.

Provide both broadcast channels (match-level topics) and user subscriptions.

Cache / gap fill

Fast in-memory cache (Redis) storing latest match snapshot + recent event history for reconnects.

API layer

REST endpoints for initial match list, match metadata, historical scorecard.

WebSocket for push updates.

Frontend

React SPA (or mobile client) subscribes to match topics and renders live scoreboard and ball-by-ball feed.

Monitoring & observability

Prometheus/Grafana or hosted monitoring for latency, error rates, API usage, cache hit ratio.

Security

Secrets manager for API keys (Vault/AWS Secrets Manager), TLS for all endpoints, input validation, CORS whitelisting.

5) Canonical data model (example JSON events)

Match snapshot (REST / initial load)

{
  "matchId": "ipl-2025-1234",
  "teams": {"home": {"id":"MI","name":"Mumbai Indians"}, "away": {"id":"CSK","name":"Chennai Super Kings"}},
  "status": "in_progress", // pre_match | in_progress | innings_break | finished
  "currentInnings": 2,
  "score": [
    {"inning":1,"team":"MI","runs":187,"wickets":4,"overs":"20.0"},
    {"inning":2,"team":"CSK","runs":120,"wickets":6,"overs":"15.3"}
  ],
  "lastUpdated": "2025-08-15T12:34:56.789Z"
}


Ball event (WebSocket push)

{
  "type":"ball",
  "matchId":"ipl-2025-1234",
  "over":16,
  "ballInOver":3,
  "batsman":"Rohit Sharma",
  "bowler":"Jasprit Bumrah",
  "runs":4,
  "extras":0,
  "wicket": false,
  "scoreAfterBall": {"team":"MI","runs":200,"wickets":5,"overs":"16.3"},
  "timestamp":"2025-08-15T12:35:03.000Z"
}

6) Real-time delivery patterns (choose one)

Push from provider (webhooks / stream) -> ideal. Consume and forward to clients with minimal latency. (Use Socket.IO rooms per match).

Polling + delta detection -> call provider every X seconds (X = provider-recommended min polling interval). Compute diffs and publish only deltas to reduce bandwidth.

Hybrid -> webhook when available + fallback polling.

Implementation notes: respect provider rate limits; implement jittered exponential backoff on 429s; use conditional requests / ETags if supported.

7) Reliability & client UX patterns

Reconnect / gap fill: on client reconnect, fetch snapshot REST endpoint and replay events from cached history to fill any missed balls.

Idempotency: events should include an incremental sequence number to dedupe re-sent events.

Graceful degradation: show “last updated X seconds ago” and fade to polling mode if real-time feed is disrupted.

Throttling on client: clients should not request updates more than necessary; server pushes deltas.

8) Security, rate limiting & caching

Store provider credentials in a secrets manager; never expose keys to frontend.

Implement per-tenant and per-IP rate limits on your public API.

Cache canonical snapshots in Redis with short TTL (e.g., 10–30s) to minimize provider calls; for ball-by-ball, append to a capped list for quick replay.

9) Observability & testing

Instrument latencies: provider → ingestion → publish → client ack.

Alerts on: ingestion failures, consecutive 429s or 5xx from provider, message lag > threshold, cache miss spike.

Automated E2E tests: simulate provider events and assert client receives correct deltas and gap-fill behavior.

10) Implementation checklist / technical stack (recommended)

Backend: Node.js (Express) + Socket.IO OR Python (FastAPI) + WebSockets; containerized (Docker).

Message bus / cache: Redis (Streams + pub/sub) or Kafka for high throughput.

DB (optional): PostgreSQL for match metadata + logs.

Frontend: React (hooks) or Next.js for SSR, Socket.IO client or native WebSocket client.

Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana, Sentry for errors.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI; Docker images to registry; IaC with Terraform / CloudFormation.

11) Example minimal flow (developer task list)

Select provider and obtain API access. (If prototyping, create account at CricAPI or API-Cricket; for production, engage SportMonks/Sportradar). 
cricapi.com
api-cricket.com
Sportmonks

Implement ingestion adapter: authorization, polling/webhook handler, parse provider payload -> normalize to canonical model.

Publish to message bus and persist recent events in Redis list per matchId.

Implement WebSocket server: clients subscribe to /match/{matchId}; server broadcasts normalized events.

Frontend: create scoreboard UI, real-time subscription, reconnect & gap-fill logic.

Add monitoring and create dashboards for: API call rate, failed calls, event publish latency, client connection count.

QA & UAT: run simulated matches; verify ordering, deduping, and reconnect behavior.

12) Sample acceptance tests (automatable)

When ingestion receives a ball event A then B then C, clients receive A→B→C in order within latency threshold.

After client disconnect, replay recency buffer returns correct sequence and final snapshot matches last event.

System recovers from provider 429 by backing off and resumes without data corruption.

13) Security & legal checklist (deliver with MVP)

Signed license / terms with data vendor permitting your usage pattern (display + caching + API limits).

Rate limit enforcement and logs of provider usage.

Privacy/data handling checklist (no PII in cricket events but log sanitization still required).

15) One-paragraph developer prompt (compact version to paste into a ticket/AI agent)

“Build a production-grade real-time IPL scoreboard: ingest live match data from a licensed cricket data API (primary) with a documented polling/webhook adapter (fallback: controlled scraping with legal sign-off), normalize to a canonical event model, persist short-term event history in Redis, and stream delta updates to browser/mobile clients via WebSockets (Socket.IO). Include REST snapshot endpoints for initial loads, reconnect/gap-fill logic, rate-limit/backoff, monitoring dashboards, and deployment artifacts (Docker + CI). Provide full docs, test cases, and an admin panel for feed health and API usage. Prioritize using SportMonks/Sportradar or similar paid provider for production; CricAPI or API-Cricket are acceptable for prototyping.”
