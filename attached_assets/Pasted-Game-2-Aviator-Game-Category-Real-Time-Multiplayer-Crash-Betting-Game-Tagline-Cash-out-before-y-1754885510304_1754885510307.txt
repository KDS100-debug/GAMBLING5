Game 2 – Aviator Game
Category: Real-Time Multiplayer Crash Betting Game
Tagline: “Cash out before you crash out.”

1. Executive Summary
A high-stakes, fast-paced, real-time betting experience where players wager on a continuously increasing multiplier tied to a virtual aircraft’s ascent. Strategic timing is everything — cash out too early and miss potential gains; wait too long and risk losing it all when the aircraft “flies away.”

2. Core Gameplay Mechanics
Betting Phase
Players select stake amounts before each round.

Support for multiple concurrent bets per player in the same round.

Countdown timer for betting window (~5–8 seconds).

Flight & Multiplier Growth
Multiplier starts at 1.00x.

Increases in real time (tick rate: ~0.01–0.05 sec).

Growth curve is pseudo-random — can accelerate or slow dynamically.

Cash-Out Mechanism
Players can cash out at any moment during the flight.

Payout Formula:

ini
Copy code
Payout = Stake × Multiplier at Cash-Out
Crash Event
At a randomly generated point (via RNG), the plane disappears.

Players who haven’t cashed out lose their stake.
